This is a augmented reality airplane shooter game.

To do tasks:
Do gradual alien direction change. Gradual direction change could be done by move 30 degrees (or some specific directional rotation) instead of directly looking at airplane. Directional change of airplane must be greater than that of the aliens.

Speed of alien needs to be greater than the airplane such that user cannot just go directly straight.

Need to make joystick -> could just be outline of grey circle with another circle on the inside that can be moved towards the direction of thumb. Need to track the rotational degree (could just be something like an angle from 0 - 360). Also need to take the distance of the inner circle center from the outer ring. This could demonstrate how much directional rotation of aliens.

Add collisions for aliens / maybe missles instead? 

Create shooting such that it can interact with the aliens
